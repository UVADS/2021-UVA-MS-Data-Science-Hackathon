# 2021-UVA-MS-Data-Science-Hackathon
The goal of the 2021 UVA Data Science Hackathon was to recreate the visualizations presented in the following Gapminder video about global CO2 emissions: https://youtu.be/4IkHtTgn3Nk

Plot 1 presents the GDP per capita of countries plotted against their CO2 emissions over time.  The bubble size represents the emission of CO2 from the whole country and the color of the bubble corresponds to each countries region.

Plot 1 focuses on the USA and CHINA and presents the GDP per capita of countries plotted against their percentage of electricity production from coal over time.  Likewise, the bubble size represents the emission of CO2 from the whole country.
